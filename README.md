The LaTeX code provided is designed to create a thesis template specifically for Pukyong National University, Korea. You can customize the script to accommodate the school's requirements. It defines the document structure, formatting, and includes various packages for different functionalities. Here's a breakdown of its key purposes:

**Document Structure:**

* **Class Definition:** `\documentclass[a4paper, 11pt, twosides, openany]{memoir}` sets the document class to `memoir`, which is a popular choice for creating long documents like theses and dissertations. It also specifies page size (A4), font size (11pt), page layout (two-sided), and chapter placement (openany).
* **Sections and Chapters:** The `\include` commands are used to include separate files containing the content for different chapters and sections of the thesis. This helps in organizing the document and makes it easier to manage large amounts of text.

**Formatting and Layout:**

* **Font:** `\usepackage{mathptmx}` sets the main font to Times New Roman.
* **Mathematical Symbols:** `\usepackage{amsmath}` and `\usepackage{amssymb}` provide various mathematical symbols and environments.
* **Korean Language Support:** `\usepackage{kotex}` enables the use of Korean text.
* **Graphics and Figures:** `\usepackage{graphicx}`, `\usepackage{wrapfig}`, `\usepackage{lscape}`, `\usepackage{rotating}`, `\usepackage{epstopdf}`, and `\usepackage{subcaption}` are used for handling images, figures, and captions.
* **Page Layout:** `\usepackage{fapapersize}` and related commands set the page margins and layout.
* **Line Spacing:** `\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.75}` adjusts the line spacing.

**Other Functionalities:**

* **Custom Commands:** `\DeclareMathAlphabet{\mathpzc}{OT1}{pzc}{m}{it}` and the definitions for `\Sz`, `\So`, `\St`, `\Ss`, `\t`, `\s`, `\fb`, and `\fs` create custom mathematical symbols and abbreviations.
* **User Settings:** The `\def` commands define various variables used throughout the document, such as the thesis title, author's name, supervisor, and committee members.
* **Bibliography:** `\usepackage{biblatex}` or `\bibliographystyle{unsrt}` and `\bibliography{backmatter/bibliography}` are used for managing and citing references.
* **Appendices:** `\appendix` indicates the start of the appendix section.
* **Acknowledgments:** A section for acknowledging contributions from others.

In summary, the LaTeX code provides a structured framework for creating a thesis, ensuring consistent formatting, and making it easier to manage and organize the content.
